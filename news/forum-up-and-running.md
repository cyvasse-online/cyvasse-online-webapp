Today, we are proud to present: [forum.cyvasse-online.com](http://forum.cyvasse-online.com)

We will create some useful categories there soon, and maybe we'll also find a theme that looks a bit better than the default one.
Of course we would love to have our own theme for the long term, and if you think you could help us with that, you should seriously [contact us](mailto:contact@cyvasse-online.com)!

For those who want to subscribe to updates about Cyvasse Online, I created the first forum topic: [Development Progess](http://forum.cyvasse-online.com/discussion/3/development-progress)
