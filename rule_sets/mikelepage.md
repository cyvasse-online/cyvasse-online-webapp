Mikelepage's Cyvasse v5.0
=========================

Object of play
--------------

You win when capturing your opponents king and preventing the opponent from promoting a new king within their
following turn. This can be accomplished by ruining the opponents fortress before capturing their king, but also by
capturing all of their tier 3 pieces that are within one move of their fortress.

Gameplay
--------

For the initial setup you have 40 "home" squares on your site of the board in which
you have to place your 19 tier 1 to tier 3 pieces and 6 mountains. You can also
place the dragon (your only tier 4 piece) inside this area, but you don't have to.

Each player also has a fortress and six terrain tiles. All of these don't occupy the tiles they are on and have
an effect on pieces standing on them. The fortress is always placed on the tile the king is placed on, and the
terrain tiles are placed where their advantaged tier 2 pieces are placed.

Your 26th piece, the dragon, can also be placed on the board during setup like all other
pieces but it doesn't have to be. It can be "brought out" as a seperate move later.

The move with which you bring out the dragon can target the fortress and all tiles in a range of 4
(the dragons range for normal moves), as long as there is no mountains piece or any own piece on them.
Capturing an opponent piece on this move is allowed.

Pieces
------

There are 10 types of piece in the game. All pieces except the mountains have a
tier level which is used to determine whether a piece can capture another piece.

Each player has

* 6 Mountains
* 6 Rabble
* 1 King
* 2 Crossbows
* 2 Spears
* 2 Light Horses
* 2 Trebuchets
* 2 Elephants
* 2 Heavy Horses
* 1 Dragon

### Mountains (passive)

![Mountains](/img/rule_sets/mikelepage/mountains.png)

Mountains are completely passive. They can't be captured and don't belong to either player.

They are placed during setup and are used to block the movement of opponents pieces.
Dragons can fly over mountains, but no piece can be on the same tile as one.

Terrain
-------

Terrain increases the effective tier of certain pieces when defending by 1 when one of those pieces stands on them.
Every terrain type has one advantaged tier 2 piece type and one advantaged tier 3 piece type.
During setup, the terrain tiles are bound to their advantaged tier 2 pieces, so that when
beginning the match, all tier 2 and tier 3 pieces are equally hard to capture.
Terrain, as well as Mountains, doesn't belong to either player.

| Type      | Placed via  | "Home terrain" for       |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Hill      | Crossbows   | Crossbows, Trebuchet     |
| Forest    | Spears      | Spears, Elephant         |
| Grassland | Light Horse | Light Horse, Heavy Horse |

**All tier 2 and 3 pieces on their home terrain**

Fortresses
----------

Fortresses, as well as terrain, provide a +1 increase of the defense tier of pieces standing in them. For fortresses
though, this works for all pieces of the player owning the fortress, except the dragon.

Fortresses can also promote pieces standing on them. There are two types of piece promotions: The first one is ordinary
"piece improving" promotion. This type of promotion only happens when it's the beginning of the turn of the player who
owns the fortress and a players piece of the type the original piece should be promoted to was captured before.

The following ordinary piece promotions are possible:

| Original piece | Promoted to |
|----------------|-------------|
| Rabble         | Crossbows   |
| Rabble         | Spears      |
| Rabble         | Light Horse |
| Crossbows      | Trebuchet   |
| Spears         | Elephant    |
| Light Horse    | Heavy Horse |

When the piece in the fortress is a rabble and there are multiple piece types it could be promoted to, the player can
choose which of those piece types it will be promoted to.

The second type of promotion is the promotion of a tier 3 piece to king. This can happen both at the beginning and the
end of a players turn and only during the turn immediately after the king was captured.

A fortress can also be ruined. This happens when it is occupied by an opponent piece and cannot be retaken on the move
immediately following the occupation. When a fortress is ruined, it is removed from the board. The player who ruined the
fortress then has to select one of the six corner tiles of the board to be used as alternative center for the hexagonal
movement of Light Horse and Heavy Horse pieces.

Capturing
---------

A piece can always capture another piece of the same or lower tier.
There is a way to capture pieces of higher tier though, it is called *flanking*.

Flanking can happen when a multiple of your pieces of lower rank have a bearing on an opponents piece of higher rank.
When the "combined" tier of your flanking pieces is equal or higher to that of the target piece, the highest-tier
piece / one of the highest-tier pieces can capture the target piece.

In the "combined" tier of your flanking pieces, every 2 or more pieces of a lower tier count
the same as n - 1 pieces of the next higher tier, where n is the count of pieces of that tier.
The king doesn't count as tier 1 piece though when flanking.
It counts as the same tier as the highest other flanking piece.

To illustrate, here are some basic examples:

* Two tier 1 pieces count as tier 2
* Two tier 2 pieces count as tier 3
* Three tier 1 pieces count as tier 3
* Three tier 2 pieces count as tier 4
* Four tier 1 pieces count as tier 4

These advanced examples show how different ranked piece can flank together:

* One tier 1 piece and one piece tier 2 can't flank
* Two tier 1 pieces and one tier 2 piece count as tier 3
* Two tier 1 pieces and one tier 3 piece can't flank
* Two tier 1 pieces and two tier 2 pieces count as tier 4
* Three tier 1 pieces and one tier 3 piece count as tier 4

Not all pieces that have a bearing on a certain target piece have to be flanking pieces.
If there are two tier 2 pieces and one tier 2 piece that all have a bearing on a tier 2 piece, you can either
directly capture it with your tier 2 piece or capture it with one of your tier 1 pieces through flanking.
