Work in progress
----------------

The game broke. For no apparent reason, probably since the last rebuild, the game didn't
allow flanking at all anymore. Obviously with this essential part of the rules gone,
there wasn't much reason left to keep the game online. As long as this notice is here,
don't expect anything to work. If the problem is found, we'll remove this notice.

We're sorry for the inconvenience.
